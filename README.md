# Saasufy AI Starter

A starter template for building AI-powered applications with [Saasufy](https://saasufy.com), a pure Web Components low-code platform.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd saasufy-ai-starter
   ```

2. **Set up your Saasufy credentials**

3. **Start building**

   Your Saasufy account is now connected! You can start building your AI-powered app using pure Web Components.
