# Saasufy Deployment and Testing

To test, you need to ask the user to deploy their Saasufy service by logging into their Dashboard and clicking on the `Deploy service` button.
It's critical that the user deploy their service after each schema change in order for it to take effect.

For testing, the user should be able to open the relevant `.html` file directly by double clicking on it (`file://` protocol).
You can suggest using a HTTP server if they run into trouble - Please offer to install one for them.
